# assign value of 42 to a variable named num
num = 42
# outputs a formatted string to the console with interpolated values
print(f"Variable names num: {num}, which type is: {type(num)}")

# assign value of 3.142 to a variable named pi
pi = 3.142
# assign value of 42/pi to our variable num
num = 42/pi
# prints a formatted string with interpolated values
print(f"Variable names num: {num}, which type is: {type(num)}, because pi type is: {type(pi)}")

# assign value of 5 to a variable named count
port = 8081
# print a concatenated string
print("Unused port: " + str(port))  # converting count to string allows is to be printed
